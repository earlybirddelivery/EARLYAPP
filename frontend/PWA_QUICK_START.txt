CUSTOMIZATION:

Need to change app name?

→ Edit PWAWidget.css for UI colors

IMPORTANT NOTES:

⚠️  Service Worker requires HTTPS in production
    (localhost works without HTTPS for testing)

⚠️  Manifest.json must be accessible at /manifest.json
    (Make sure it's in frontend/public/)

⚠️  Clear cache during development:
    DevTools > Application > Clear storage > Clear site data

⚠️  Service worker updates check every 60 seconds
    (Configure in frontend/src/index.js)
