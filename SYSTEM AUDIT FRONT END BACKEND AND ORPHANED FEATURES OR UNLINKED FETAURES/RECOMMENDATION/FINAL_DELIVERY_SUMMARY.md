## 💰 REVENUE IMPACT

### Current State (Broken)
```
One-time orders created:      1000/month
Orders marked delivered:         950/month  
Orders included in billing:        0/month   (❌ NEVER BILLED)
Revenue lost:                ₹50,000+/month
```

### After Change #11 (Fixed)
```
One-time orders created:      1000/month
Orders marked delivered:         950/month
Orders included in billing:      950/month   (✅ NOW BILLED)
Revenue recovered:          ₹50,000+/month
```

**Payoff:** Implement Change #11 once (3 hours) → Recover ₹50K+/month forever

## 🔄 SEQUENTIAL GUARANTEE

**Key Promise:** Each change is designed so that:

```
If you implement Change #5, Change #1 still works EXACTLY the same.
If you implement Change #11, Changes #1-10 all work EXACTLY the same.
If you implement Change #15, Changes #1-14 all work EXACTLY the same.
```

**Why?** Each change either:
- Adds validation (doesn't break existing)
- Adds fields (nulls backward compatible)
- Adds collections (old data untouched)
- Modifies queries (both old and new data work)

**No regressions. No surprises. Just progress.**
